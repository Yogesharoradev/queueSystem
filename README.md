# Backend System Design Using Queue

## Objective

This project aims to design and implement a backend system that efficiently manages requests from multiple users using a queue structure. Each client connected will have its queue, where all requests will be processed sequentially. The system ensures robustness, scalability, and effective management of multiple client connections.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Securely authenticate users before processing requests.
- **Request Queueing**: Implement a queue for each client to handle requests in a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) manner.
- **Request Processing**: Sequential handling of requests through worker processes.
- **Concurrency Management**: Handle multiple clients and their queues concurrently.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale efficiently with increasing users and requests.
- **Robustness**: Error handling and recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for tracking and performance monitoring.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Node.js
- **Messaging/Queueing System**: RabbitMQ / Redis / Kafka
- **Database**: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- **Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## System Architecture

![System Architecture Diagram](path/to/system-architecture-diagram.png)

The architecture includes:

- **Client**: Users interact through a client interface that sends requests to the server.
- **Queue Management**: Each client connection has a dedicated queue managed by a Queue Manager.
- **Worker Processes**: Dedicated processes that pull requests from the queues and execute them sequentially.
- **Database**: Stores user information and request logs.

## Implementation

### User Authentication

Implemented user authentication using JWT to secure endpoints.

### Request Queueing

Each client has a dedicated queue managed using a queueing system (RabbitMQ/Redis/Kafka) to handle requests in FIFO order.

### Worker Processes

Worker processes listen for requests in the queue and execute them sequentially, ensuring that the requests are handled properly.

## Testing

- Unit tests are written to verify the functionality of the authentication, queue management, and request processing components.

## Deployment

- The system is containerized using Docker. Each component (frontend, backend, database, messaging system) has its Dockerfile for easy deployment.

### Docker Setup

1. Build Docker images:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
